To run the app- npm install in both backend and frontend folders and visit http://localhost:3000. 
.env files are not supposed to be created with this project as I've added constants for portnumber and database keys. everything else is hardcoded for the sake of simplicity.

to run backend- nodemon
to run frontend- npm start 


Hope you like it!
